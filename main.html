        This was my first semester with COSI and unfortuantely my last, being a senior. I contributed by attending every meeting, 
        doing lightning talks on Neocities, [insert others...], helping with the game preservation/emulation station, and assisting 
        in the documenting of COSIs library and magazines.

        Finally applying coding knowledge to exciting and fun projects was my biggest goal this semester. I felt that as a graduating senior,
        I should have work that I am proud of to show off. Making this website, sharing my interests with others and connecting through shared
        interests made me feel a lot more confident in my skillset and gave me ambition to continue growing.
