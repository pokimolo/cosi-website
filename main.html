      Overview
    </h3>

      <p>
        This was my first semester with COSI (and unfortuantely my last, since I'm graduating). I contributed by attending every meeting, attending workshops, 
        doing lightning talks on Neocities and a PS4 kiosk, and helping with the game preservation/emulation station.
