      Overview
    </h3>
    <div class="div-2">
      <p>
        This was my first semester with COSI (and unfortuantely my last, since I'm graduating). I contributed by attending every meeting, 
        doing lightning talk on Neocities, and helping with the game preservation/emulation station. I also learned a bunch
        of HTML and CSS through making this website.

      Hanging Out
    </h3>
    <div class="div-2">
      <p>
        I brought my modded Wii in for people to play with and shared modding experiences with other people with the game preservation team.

      Personal Learning
    </h3>
    <div class="div-2">
      <p>
          I explored and took inspiration from various Neocities, then learned how to recreate some of my favorite aspects in HTML and CSS. <br>
          I brought a couple Raspberry Pis into COSI and learned about how to use them, along with an Arduino Uno. <br>
          I learned how to install linux onto computers and create boot drives. Put Mint Xfce on a PC for someone.<br>
