        This was my first semester with COSI (and unfortuantely my last, since I'm graduating). I contributed by attending every meeting, 
        doing lightning talk on Neocities, [insert others...], and helping with the game preservation/emulation station. I also learned a bunch
        of HTML and CSS through making this website.

        Finally applying coding knowledge to exciting and fun projects was my biggest goal this semester. I felt that as a graduating senior,
        I should have work that I am proud of to show off. Making this website, sharing my interests with others and connecting through shared
        interests made me feel a lot more confident in my skillset and gave me ambition to continue growing.

          <li>I explored and took inspiration from various Neocities, then learned how to recreate some of my favorite aspects in HTML and CSS.</li>
          <li>I brought a couple Raspberry Pis into COSI and learned about how to use them.</li>
          <li>I brought my modded Wii in and learned about modding consoles and emulating games from the game preservation station.</li>
